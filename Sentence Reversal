Sentence Reversal

Problem:

Given a string of words, reverse all the words. For example:

Given:

'This is the best'
Return:

'best the is This'
As part of this exercise you should remove all leading and trailing whitespace. So that inputs such as:

'  space here'  and 'space here      '
both become:

'here space'

Solution:

# 1st method

def rev_word1(s):
    return " ".join(reversed(s.split()))

#2nd method

def rev_word2(s):
    return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])

#3rd method

def rev_word(s):
    
    words = []
    length = len(s)
    space = [' ']
    
    i = 0
    
    while i< length:
        
        if s[i] not in space:
            
            word_start = i
            
            while i < length and s[i] not in space:
                
                i += 1
            words.append(s[word_start:i])
            
        i += 1
        
    return " ".join(words[::-1])
